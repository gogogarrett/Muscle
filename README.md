## What is muscle?

Muscle is a responsive CSS Framework that serves a 960 pixel wide 12 column grid by default that flexes up to fit perfect into the 1140 pixel wide threshold. On smaller screens it will make intelligent jumps to adapt to the width of the browser, as well as fit perfectly among the most popular handheld devices.

Stop being held back by little frameworks that don't carry their own weight; step up and show off your muscles.

## Why was it made?

There is by no means a lack of CSS Frameworks to be found out there, so what makes this one any different? It's awesome. You design once, and your work is done. Muscle works by optimizing the newest technologies and uses media queries to make intelligent jumps that we combined with a little bit of our lazy personalities to create a framework that allows you to spend as little time as possible bringing your design to the web, and ensuring your webpage looks good in every possible viewport.

## What does it have?

We provide you with a reset and with that we include a base set of minimal typography initializers in which we highly suggest you override, or delete all together depending on your projects needs.

You have a fancy smart phone? You have a fancy tablet? You like things to be fancy? Muscle is fancy; it simply works. Fancy.

## The Gear

**`.container`**<br>
allows the div to expand to the full width of the browser, and has padding on both side to separate the content from the window as it is resized. This class is ideal for background images or colors that expand beyond the wrapper and span the full width of the browser. You can use multiple of these on your page to divide the content of your page up into different sections.

**`.row`**<br>
encapsulates your columns within. It centers them and defines a set width.

**`.col1`, `.col2`, `.col3`, `.col4`, `.col5`, `.col6`, `.col7`, `.col7`, `.col9`, `.col10`, `.col11`, `.col12`**<br>
are the classes for each column. They are to be used to layout the page in any combination you desire within a row that adds up to be twelve.

**`.prefix1`, `.prefix2`, `.prefix3`, `.prefix4`, `.prefix5`, `.prefix6`, `.prefix7`, `.prefix8`, `.prefix9`, `.prefix10`, `.prefix11`,**<br>
**`.suffix1`, `.suffix2`, `.suffix3`, `.suffix4`, `.suffix5`, `.suffix6`, `.suffix7`, `.suffix8`, `.suffix9`, `.suffix10`, `.suffix11`**<br>
These are classes to help you shimmy stuff where you need it. You can add space before or after and maintain your layout by using these helpers.

**`.push1`, `.push2`, `.push3`, `.push4`, `.push5`, `.push6`, `.push7`, `.push8`, `.push9`, `.push10`, `.push11`**<br>
**`.pull1`, `.pull2`, `.pull3`, `.pull4`, `.pull5`, `.pull6`, `.pull7`, `.pull8`, `.pull9`, `.pull10`, `.pull11`**<br>
These are classes to help you rearrange positions of elements regardless of where they lie in the markup. They use relative and left positioning that allows you to push and pull elements to where you see fit.

**`.alpha`, `.omega`**<br>
are two helper classes that assist you with nesting children divs within parent divs by eliminating margins. alpha - left margin, and omega - right margin.

**`.last`**<br>
The last column within a row needs the class to ensure there is no right margin and that all columns fit within the row
